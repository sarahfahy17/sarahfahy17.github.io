	There is a lot of content fit into this small space, many of which are variables, such as what type of ticket (concession, child, adult), the receipt number, and the date. Some elements, however, would remain constant, at least for this exhibition, such as the location within the NGV building, the ABN, and the terms and conditions statement. There are “so many variables when it comes to ticket designs and content” (Sofie Johansson, NGV 2020).
