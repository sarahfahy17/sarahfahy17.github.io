<div class="title">TICKET DESIGN</div>
<div class="body">
	There is a lot of content fit into the small space of a ticket, many of which are variables, such as what type of ticket it is (concession, child, adult), the receipt number, and the date. Some elements, however, would remain constant in the ticket content, such as the location within the theatre or exhibition building, the business number, and the terms and conditions statement. There are “so many variables when it comes to ticket designs and content” (Sofie Johansson, NGV 2020).
